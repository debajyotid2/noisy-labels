# Learning with noisy-labels
Implementation of https://github.com/filipe-research/tutorial_noisylabels in Tensorflow

Label noise is a common problem in data collected from the internet by web scraping, or through human annotations. This project deals with developing a robust algorithm that can overcome symmetric and asymmetric label noise in supervised image classification tasks.

The original implementation in PyTorch can be seen in the Jupyter Notebook *tutorial_sibgrapi20.ipynb*. The Tensorflow reimplementation is in *noisy_labels_tut.ipynb*.
